E001

     Internal error.  The compiler tried to place a string into a buffer,
     but the buffer was too small.

     Try increasing the value of the /Space constant in strings.fs.


E002
     Symbol already defined.  A program tried to declare a word as an external
     label, but it's either already declared or has been defined by a previous
     colon definition.

     Remediation is to use another name, or change the name of the 
     previously defined symbol.


E003
     Internal error.  The compiler tried to reference an interned string,
     but the parameter was corrupted.

     Remediation involves tracking down why the intern handle is corrupted.
     Most likely cause is data stack imbalance.


E004
     Internal error.  The compiler tried to create a symbol binding between
     an internal and an external name, but the table is full.

     Remediation: Try increasing the value of #symbols in symtab.fs.


E005
     Symbol not defined.

     Remediation: Make sure the symbol is defined or declared before
     using it.


E006

     Symbol expected while defining an xname or colon definition.  This can be
     caused by one of several causes:

     1. Either the internal or the external symbol name is missing in an
     xname: construction.

     2. A colon definition is missing its required argument, the name of the
     definition.

     Remediation: Use the proper syntax for the construction in question.
